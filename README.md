- yarn install
- then it actually runs

just a weird attempt at making a website and learning nextjs, made following the tutorial somewhat loosely
and the power of hope and imagination touching random things hoping it didnt break completely

if it doesnt run, the power of hope and imagination ran out.

also no .env files so it doesnt actually run past the welcome page for anyone other than me but i doubt someone will try to run it
